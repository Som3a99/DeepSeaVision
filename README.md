## 🎓 DEPI Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative Scholarship Project

This project is proudly submitted as part of the graduation requirements for the AI and Data Science track, with a focus on the Microsoft Machine Learning Engineer job profile.

### 🚀 Project Overview

DeepSeaVision is a cutting-edge machine learning solution designed to identify and classify various types of trash in underwater environments. Our mission is to contribute to ocean cleanup efforts by providing a powerful tool that can accurately detect and categorize marine debris.

#### 🌟 Key Features

- 🔍 Real-time object detection of underwater trash
- 🏷️ Classification of debris into categories (e.g., plastic, metal, glass)
- 📷 Seamless integration with underwater camera systems
- 🖥️ User-friendly interface for easy deployment and use
